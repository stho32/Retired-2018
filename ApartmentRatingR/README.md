# ApartmentR

Target of this project is to create a set of R helpers to 
calculate a value for a flat. 

At the moment of this writing I look for a new flat in my
area to rent. Unfortunately the prices for renting go up, and I want to 
make sure that I get a good value and price security.

Since the online tools available to me do not allow me to 
enter all criteria I'd like, I had the idea to create this
flat rating engine, where you can add different rules and their
weight and thus easily scale a search over time and 
area.

I live in Berlin so the engine is optimized for that area at the moment. 
I do not know much about renting apartments in other areas, maybe learning about
that will come with time. 

Example ideas for criteria: 
  - Access to public transport
  - How close is it to my employer?
  - How much time does it need to get to my employer by foot, by public transport and by car? 
  - How many steps / day do I need to make on an average working day? (e.g. 10000 would ultimately keep me healthy without extra sports. More would be a waste of time, less would enable me to have more spare time that I can choose to invest either in steps or other stuff)
  - How many different options do I have using public transport to get to my employer? Are there at least more than 1, because public transport can easily get funny.
  - Doctors? 
  - What if I need to buy something like food? 
  - Violence and crime statistics of the area?
  - Sights? Cinema? Other freetime activities nearby?
  - Community? Are the people in that area organized? Do they talk to each other? Do they throw parties?
  - Are the people in the area of my age ?
